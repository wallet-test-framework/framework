        <h1>Wallet Test Framework</h1>
        <p>
            This page will run your Ethereum wallet through a set of tests that
            check against the
            <a
                href="https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/"
                >JSON-RPC specification</a
            >. This is a work in progress, and tests are being added regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you have an Ethereum wallet configured and click the
            "connect" link to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do not use an account with real assets!</strong> While the
            tests use a simulated blockchain, it's safer to not take any risks.
